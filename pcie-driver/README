1. PCIE driver for FPGA device

1.1. Overview

This driver is based on original driver for the PCIe SG DMA project
placed at the opencores.org
As of now, the changes are mostly reworked Makefiles to fit into the
directory structure at the OHWR repo; also, with present makefiles
it's easier to cross-compile code (e.g. using buildroot).

It consists of two parts:
- kernel driver at driver/pcie
- c/c++ library at lib/pcie
All relevant includes are in include/pcie folder.

1.2. INSTALL

To compile and install kernel driver go to driver/pcie and issue 'make && make install'

To install library go to lib/pcie and type 'make && make install'

1.3. TODO

- review and commit original test units
- port to PowerPC
- any changes that will be required
